      <h3>How cats can improve your overall health</h3>
      <p>Cats can have a surprisingly positive impact on your health. Spending time with them helps reduce stress and
        anxiety, as petting a cat releases calming chemicals in the brain. Their gentle purring can lower blood pressure
        and promote relaxation, while the companionship they provide helps combat loneliness and boost overall mood.
        Caring for a cat also encourages routine and responsibility, which can support mental well-being. In short, cats
        are more than just cute companions—they can contribute to a healthier, happier life.</p>

      <h3>Tips for new cat owners</h3>
      <p>If you’re a new cat owner, a few simple tips can make the transition smoother for both you and your feline
        friend. Start by creating a safe, quiet space where your cat can retreat and feel secure. Provide fresh water,
        quality food, and a clean litter box in an easily accessible spot. Playtime is important—interactive toys help
        your cat burn energy and build trust with you. Be patient and let your cat approach at their own pace, as
        forcing
        interaction can cause stress. Lastly, schedule regular vet checkups to keep your cat healthy and happy.</p>

      <h3>Flowers that actually aren't cat friendly</h3>
      <p>Not all flowers are safe for cats, and some common ones can actually be toxic. Lilies are especially
        dangerous—even a small amount can cause serious kidney problems. Other flowers to avoid include tulips,
        daffodils,
        chrysanthemums, and azaleas, which may lead to stomach upset, drooling, or worse if ingested. If you share your
        home with a cat, it’s best to keep these plants out of reach and choose pet-safe alternatives like roses,
        sunflowers, or orchids instead.</p>

      <h3>5 foods you didn't know were toxic for cats</h3>
      <p>Some everyday foods that seem harmless can actually be toxic for cats. Here are five you might not know about:

        Onions and garlic – even small amounts can damage red blood cells.

        Grapes and raisins – may cause kidney failure.

        Chocolate – contains theobromine, which is dangerous for cats.

        Alcohol – even tiny sips can be very harmful.

        Caffeine (coffee, tea, energy drinks) – can affect the heart and nervous system.

        Keeping these foods out of reach helps protect your cat’s health and prevents emergency vet visits</p>
